# Base Template

***

Kyle's Base template for future projects.

***

## Setup

1. If you're not already set up to run PHP applications locally, you'll want to install that first.  Some good options would be [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) for OS X, or [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) if you're running Windows.
2. Clone the repository into your desired folder. For Windows with WAMP, your default root will be C:\wamp\www. For OS X with MAMP, your default root will be something like /Applications/MAMP/htdocs.
3. Go into the root directory of the project and open up settings.php.  You'll want to change the environment to "local" and also change the local environment settings to match your username/password/databasename.
4. Start up MAMP/WampServer if you haven't already, open up your browser,and navigate to http://localhost/. If the project is in a subdirectory (e.g BaseTemplate) you will need to navigate to http://localhost/BaseTemplate
5. Aaand you're done, time to start on your real project
